## Research Discovery

### Citations and References

A citation is an external source of information that is mentioned ('cited') in the body of a paper ('in-text' or 'inline'). Usually, the style of the citation is terse, and may be enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. For example, a citation might look like this: [1] or this: (Kraiser, 2011). However, there are [many citation formats](https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/Where-can-I-find-formatted-examples-of-different-Citation-styles?language=en_US), and for papers that have been published after passing through a submission process, the format used is usually dictated by the rules for submission of the organization through which the paper was published.

A reference is a more full textual description of an external source, designed to allow the reader to obtain the referenced item as a primary source. References are typically collected in a list in a References or Bibliography section toward the end of the paper. Usually, every reference must have been cited somewhere in the paper, and usually every citation has a corresponding reference. However, there are many reference styles, and, for example in [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/), cited personal correspondence that was private and is not accessible to the reader does not need a corresponding reference. The reference style is typically defined as part of the citation style.

### The Citation Graph

Irrespective of their format, citations and/or references act as directed edges in a vast knowledge graph, known as The Citation Graph. In this context, work A is said to cite work B, if work A contains a citation or reference to paper B. The citation graph is a directed graph, since the act of work A citing work B does not imply that work B cites work A. i.e. citation is an asymmetric relation between works. 

The Citation Graph has been called "[one of humankind's most important intellectual achievements](https://boingboing.net/2018/04/14/open-graphs.html)" (by Dario Taraborelli (@readermeter), the Director of Research at the @Wikimedia Foundation).
